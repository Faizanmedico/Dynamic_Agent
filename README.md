# Dynamic_Agent
This final project brings together the concepts of:

Modular Tools: Organizing functionalities into reusable modules.

Dynamic Decision-Making: The agent trying to "figure out" which tool to use based on the input.

Parameter Extraction: Even if rudimentary, the agent attempts to pull out necessary information (like 'location' or 'expression') for its tools.

Conversational Flow: Maintaining an interactive dialogue.

While we've used simple if/elif logic for "reasoning" and "tool selection," in real-world advanced agentic AI, these parts are powered by large language models (LLMs) which are far more sophisticated at understanding intent, generating plans, and dynamically calling tools.
